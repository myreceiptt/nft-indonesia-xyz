## Maintenance by Prof. NOTA Evergreen Standard

This repo is intended to stay evergreen while remaining production-safe.

### Runtime

- Node: **24.x** (see `.nvmrc` and `package.json#engines`)
- Package manager:

  - **NPM** (lockfile: `package-lock.json`)
  - ~~Yarn (lockfile: `yarn.lock`)~~
  - ~~PNPM (lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`)~~

- Deploy target:

  - **Vercel**
  - ~~Netlify~~
  - ~~Self-hosted / Docker~~
  - ~~Other platform (document explicitly)~~

### Monthly Safe Updates (recommended)

1. Check what’s outdated:

   - `npm outdated`
   - ~~yarn outdated~~
   - ~~pnpm outdated~~

2. Upgrade safe (patch/minor) versions:

   - `npm update`
   - ~~yarn upgrade~~
   - ~~pnpm update~~
   - or upgrade specific packages shown as non-major

3. Verify:

   - `npm audit --audit-level=moderate`
   - ~~yarn audit~~
   - ~~pnpm audit~~
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run build`
   - ~~yarn build~~
   - ~~pnpm build~~

4. Deploy:

   - **Vercel auto-deploy from `main`**
   - ~~manual deploy according to platform workflow~~

### Major Updates (quarterly / scheduled)

Major upgrades (framework, runtime, or core tooling) must be done one at a time, with a dedicated PR and full testing.

Examples:

- Node major version
- Next.js / React major version
- Tailwind CSS major version
- Package manager major version
