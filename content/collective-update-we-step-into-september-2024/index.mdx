### Raden Saleh

Raden Saleh by [**@bywillak**](https://x.com/bywillak)

Raden Saleh was a renowned Indonesian artist of Javanese origin. He is considered one of the most important painters of the Dutch colonial period in Indonesia. Born in 1807, Raden Saleh first received training in traditional Javanese art. Later, he moved to Batavia (now Jakarta) to study Western art. He then traveled to Europe to further hone his skills and became the first Indonesian painter to gain recognition in Western art. Raden Saleh's works often portrayed scenes from Javanese life and European landscapes, showcasing his unique blend of indigenous and Western artistic styles.

### Contemplation

Contemplation by [**@Feriwe88**](https://x.com/Feriwe88).

This is my latest work, based on my black and white work (drawing) on paper then I put digital coloring to make illustration art.  
This work tells the story of a person who tries to distance himself from his previous life to receive enlightenment from God, well you know this is a way of life...contemplation...  
I took this idea from Javanese culture, about a powerful man who spent decades in a forest, well maybe he was like Sidharta Gautama in India.  
This person in Javanese culture is called Sunan Kali Jaga...he is a Javanese mystical symbol who is believed to bring enlightenment and inner peace...  
Hopefully, this can also be a symbol for all of you...
